tk-multi-workfiles-mik
==================
This is a fork of tk-multi-workfiles from shotgun toolkit to replicate Mikros Image Vfx pipeline behavior
https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-multi-workfiles

## Changes in behavior:
* changed default config to always start a new version number when creating (saving) a new variant.
* changed default behavior to always show all current work files for a given asset
* changed versionning to keep track of all work files across artists
